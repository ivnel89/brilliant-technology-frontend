## Notes
If I had the time, I would have done a few more things.
- Split the jquery code into more individual components.
- Use webpack instead of parcel for bundling.  
- make the FE more event driven, by using custom events
- Add better loading indicators
- Handle API loading failures
- Configure the tests to work & write more tests
- Possibly testing e2e using cypress
